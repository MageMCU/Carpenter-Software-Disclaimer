              Parents and Teachers: This Github Account is restricted to minors.
              When working with electricity of any kind, they should be directed
              and instructed by a responsible mentor. A USER and/or (<em>
                AIIIESS MIT LICENSEE</em
              >) must be at least 13 years of age when using GitHub.

        <h2>Minors (Children) and Teenagers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              All children and teenagers, please consult with your parent (your
              guardian, your mentor or your teacher) before experimenting with
              any of these electronic circuits. Never work with electricity
              alone.

              <span class="kills">Electricity Kills</span>, see notice.
            </p>
            <p>
              NOTICE: Keep flammables and non-flammables away from Power
              Supplies connected to circuit boards. Use a power supply with an
              enclosed case to protect minors. Best practice is the out-of-reach and the keep-hands-off 
              approach when instructing the young. Horseplay should be discouraged and 
              consequential for dismissal...
